This project analyzes credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activity using machine learning techniques. Using a dataset from Kaggle, we applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers after careful data preprocessing and feature scaling. The dataset showed significant class imbalance, which posed challenges for model accuracy and fairness. Among the models tested, KNN showed the highest accuracy and best performance overall. The report includes detailed model evaluation through metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The goal is to provide a practical ML-based solution to enhance fraud detection systems and protect users and institutions from financial loss.
